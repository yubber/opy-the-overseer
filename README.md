made in overpy for the overwatch workshop

![tech demo](www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzNI82DdD8M)

the default "create HUD" actions are extremely limited, so the HUD was created using "in-world texts" which are rendered at a specific position in the world. this position was calculated to be always in front of the player for static HUD. the deposits in the world also had to be created from scratch.

i will probably not finish the game

code is under "new" folder.
